## Description

Record embedded rust learnings with nucleo f401re development board

## TODOS

- [x] Read encoder values from motor
- [x] Test pwm, drive motor with fixed duty cycle
- [x] Test pid, control motor velocity
- [ ] Test `micropb`, send controlled data and receive command
- [ ] Test IMU, read IMU settings
- [ ] Create UI that reads controlled data and sends command to the board
- [ ] Check S-curve motion interpolation, implement it in the board
